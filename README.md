# WhisperEchoes [Proof of Concept]
Experience the wonder of conversation without language barriers. This nimble audio translator lends you the power to seamlessly converse in a multitude of languages. It listens, interprets, and echoes back in the language of your choiceâ€”effortlessly, accurately, instantly.

WhisperEchoes is a real-time translation application that harnesses the power of [OpenAI's SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) and [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor) for on-the-fly speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversions. Designed to facilitate direct communication between two individuals who do not share a common language, WhisperEchoes provides an immediate spoken language translation, enabling each party to speak and listen in their native tongue.

## Features
- Real-Time Translation: Engage in conversations with speakers of any language using immediate audio translation.
- OpenAI API Integration: Implements the latest OpenAI API for reliable speech recognition and synthesis.
- User-Friendly GUI: Simple terminal interface powered by [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/).
- Continuous Interaction: Designed for ongoing dialogue, allowing for multiple exchanges in a single session.

## Installation

```
conda create --name whisper-echoes -c conda-forge python=3.11
conda activate whisper-echoes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To start a real-time translation session for a conversation, run the following command adding two [ISO 639-1 language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes):

```
python app.py <language_code_1> <language_code_2>
```

Example for translating a conversation between an english and a spanish speaker:

```
python whisper_echoes.py en es
```

Upon initiation, the application will prompt each user to speak after pressing 'Enter'. It will then translate and read out loud the translated speech in the other user's language.
